    <p><h2>The whole jounrey began 7 years back, when Mr.Abc asked himself,"How did we
        become what we are now?"
    </h2></p>
    <p><h2>He found his answer--through education! </h2></p>
    <p><h2>It was then decided that he would open up a school to educate the next
         generation!
    </h2></p>
    <p><h2>7 years later, this is what his dream looks like... He is the brain of this school and
            a great visionary.
    </h2></p> 
    <p><h2>Thank you, Mr.Abc</h2></p>
